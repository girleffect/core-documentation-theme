                <h3>How we load the CSS, once received</h3>
                <p>To cater for as many devices as possible, we start with a feature phone stylesheet that is as small as possible, but covers our bases. Once that is done, we <strong>add</strong> the enhanced stylesheet below that (using feature detection). The enhanced stylesheet then <strong>inherits</strong> from the feature phone styling.</p>
                <p class="warning">Please note that both your feature and enhanced stylesheets will <strong>inherit</strong> from the default theme.</p>
                <h3>How to go about theming the pages</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>We've included the <a href="/pages/css/theme.feature.css" class="on">feature</a> and <a href="/pages/css/theme.enhanced.css" class="on">enhanced</a> stylesheets into the <span class="code">head</span> of every page below in exactly the same way it will be done once integrated. </li>
                    <li>They are located at <span class="code">/pages/css/theme.feature.css</span> and <span class="code">/pages/css/theme.enhanced.css</span></li>
                    <li>You can now open those up in your favourite editor and start creating your own theme.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="message">Both these template files look exactly the same, with the same classes. You'll only use some of them for feature styling. Please make sure to remove the unused declarations. <br /><br />Feel free to add whatever you need to either of these files to get to your own perfectly customized theme.</p>
                <h3>Get started with your theme</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="/pages/login.html" target="_blank">Login</a></li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Sending your theme</h3>
                <p>Please remember to send along any images and fonts you reference in your CSS files.</p>
